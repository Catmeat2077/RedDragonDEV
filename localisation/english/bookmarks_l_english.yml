 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Summer is Ending"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Red Dragon '95"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
